  abstract = {Benefits of carbon sequestration in agricultural soils are well recognized, and process-based models have been developed to better understand sequestration potential. However, most studies ignore the uncertainty arising during model prediction—a critical requirement for scientific understanding, policy implementation and carbon emission trading. Furthermore, the dependencies created in process-based models due to many parameters and a relatively small set of empirical data hinder parameterization. We have implemented a Bayesian approach using the sampling importance resampling (SIR) method to calibrate the DayCent ecosystem model for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, and to quantify uncertainty in model predictions. A SOC dataset compiled from 19 long-term field experiments, representing 117 combinations of management treatments, with 491 measurements of SOC, was split into independent datasets for model calibration and evaluation. The most important DayCent model parameters were identified through a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) for parameterization and SIR was used to calibrate the model and produce posterior distributions for the most sensitive parameters. On average, the Bayesian calibration reduced the model uncertainty by a factor of 6.6 relative to the uncertainty associated with the prior. The Bayesian model analysis framework will allow for ongoing updates to the model as new datasets and model structural improvements are made in future research, and overall provide a stronger basis for models to support policy and management decisions associated with GHG mitigation through C sequestration in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {Study region: This study used data collected from three cropland sites (two in Manitoba and one in Prince Edward Island) in Canada. Study focus: In efforts to accurately describe the water dynamics in agricultural soils, most of the agri-hydrological models developed are highly complex, such that they require detailed input data, of which most of them are not always measured or otherwise readily available. However, the comprehensive and complex representations of the processes may not be justified when data is scarce. Thus, this study developed a soil water budget model that could describe the movement of water through Canadian agricultural soils using a few parameters only. The model was developed by selecting algorithms from various existing models, whose data requirements are readily available in literature and public Canadian databases.},
